Merry Taskmas is fully accessible via modern web browsers and is responsive across all screen sizes. Its goal is to simplify holiday organization, reduce seasonal stress, and add a bit of festive cheer to everyday planning.

While other task management apps exist, Merry Taskmas is uniquely tailored to the Christmas holidays, offering specialized features like the Christmas countdown, gift tracker, and holiday-themed user interface.

## Future Development Plans:
- Enhanced gift list capabilities, such as tagging gifts with recipient preferences or marking gifts as “shipped” or “wrapped.”
- Interactive meal planner with built-in recipe suggestions for traditional holiday dishes.
- Ability to sync tasks, events, and shopping lists across devices.
- A sharing feature for collaborative planning with family and friends.

**Merry Taskmas** aims to bring joy, simplicity, and organization to every user’s Christmas season, fostering a stress-free and memorable holiday.

## UX - User Experience

### Design Inspiration

The design of **Merry Taskmas** was inspired by the previous project work of the development team. With this being the final bootcamp hackathon and the holiday season upon us, the team decided that a Christmas theme would be the perfect fit. 

The festive design aims to create a cheerful and engaging experience for users while maintaining functionality and simplicity to help them stay organized during the holidays.

## Agile Methodologies - Project Management

**Merry Taskmas** was built using Agile methodology. Our team used the [GitHub Project Board](https://github.com/users/TaylaJBall/projects/3) to track our tasks, organize user stories, and ensure the project stayed within Scope. 

The board served as a central hub for documenting progress and maintaining focus throughout the development process.


### MoSCoW Prioritization

I chose to follow the MoSCoW Prioritization method for LitRPG Library, identifying and labelling my:

- **Must Haves**: the 'required', critical components of the project. 
- **Should Haves**: the components that are valuable to the project but not absolutely 'vital' at the MVP stage. The 'Must Haves' must receive priority over the 'Should Haves'.
- **Could Haves**: these are the features that are a 'bonus' to the project, it would be nice to have them in this phase, but only if the most important issues have been completed first and time allows.
- **Won't Haves**: the features or components that either no longer fit the project's brief or are of very low priority for this release.
